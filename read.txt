# this file should be located in /Lapras/NAND Backup upon constructing the directories
This is the NAND Backup folder. 
It should be empty, and that is because this is the directory where you should store your Nintendo 3DS NAND files (.bin, .sha, .exefs)
Please move this directory to a secure location or a cloud backup drive (Google Drive, Dropbox).

Thank you for using Lapras, happy modding!
