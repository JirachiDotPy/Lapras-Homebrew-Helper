# Lapras-Homebrew-Helper
A multi-OS compatible homebrew helper that just makes getting needed downloads easier.
I am aware that all download links are very easy to click and access on the 3dshacksguide website.
This tool is made for those like myself who homebrew 3DA consoles as a side-job/business, and simply want
the downloads all laid out in a CLI.
